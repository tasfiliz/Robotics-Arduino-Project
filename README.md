# Robotics-Arduino-Project
  In our project, we built a robot that can detect objects and distinguish them by their colors. The robot moves in a room and using its gripper on the front side, it grabs objects which is perceived by its sensors. Then, it lifts the object and throw it into a funnel, and then it separates objects into baskets which are placed on the robot according to color of object by using its RGB sensor and contains objects with the same colors. We used Arduino platform in this project to realize.
